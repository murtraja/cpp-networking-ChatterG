# cpp-networking-ChatterG
A sample project to demonstrate multiple clients, single server socket programming usage in the context of a game environment

A very quick and dirty networking assignment that involves
1.	A server who hosts a game simulation
2.	Clients who provide input, and send it to server
3.	Server runs the simulation based on the inputs, sends the updated state to all the clients

Plus Feature: Any number of clients can join the game any time, they will get the updated state
